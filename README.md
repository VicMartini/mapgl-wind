## MapGL Wind

A WebGL-powered visualization of wind power.

This project is a fork of Mapbox's [WebGL Wind](https://github.com/mapbox/webgl-wind). The aim of this fork is to provide:

- TypeScript support
- An easily installable npm package
- A mapbox-gl compatible custom layer for seamless integration with mapbox-gl maps
- Draping support for rendering with the globe projection (From this [unmerged branch](https://github.com/mapbox/webgl-wind/tree/astojilj-draping-support) by @astojilj)

In turn, the original project is heavily inspired by the work of:

- [Cameron Beccario](https://twitter.com/cambecc)
  and his wonderful [Earth project](https://earth.nullschool.net/)
  with its [open-source version](https://github.com/cambecc/earth).
- [Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg](http://hint.fm/) and their
  [US Wind Map project](http://hint.fm/projects/wind/).
- [Chris Wellons](http://nullprogram.com) and his WebGL tutorials,
  in particular [A GPU Approach to Particle Physics](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/).
- [Greggman](http://games.greggman.com/game/) and his [WebGL Fundamentals](http://webglfundamentals.org/) guide.
